Intro

I just heard the best way to grow subs, views and likes is, yes right, to make videos about subs, views and likes.
Acabo de escuchar que la mejor manera de aumentar los subs, las vistas y los me gusta es, sí, claro, hacer videos sobre subs, vistas y me gusta.
Je viens d'entendre que la meilleure façon d'augmenter les abonnements, les vues et les likes est, oui, de faire des vidéos sur les abonnements, les vues et les likes.
Ich habe gerade gehört, der beste Weg, um Subscriptions, Views und Likes zu bekommen, ist
Ja, klar, Videos über Subscribtions, Views und Likes zu machen.

Tip 1 (clean up channel, make it look professionel)
---------
So, my first tip is to actually clean
up your YouTube channel when I say clean
up I mean remove old videos that are no
longer relevant or have very bad quality

so let's say that your latest video is
really good quality and your viewers
actually think about subscribing after
seeing that video but once they go to
your channel and scroll down a bit they
see your old videos that are really bad
and that doesn't have any quality at all
and if they watched that video or those
videos then they're actually less likely
to hit subscribe and be a loyal follower
to your page so my tip is to actually
delete all the old videos or all videos
that don't that don't have good quality

and actually if you don't want to delete
them if you want them for like you know
in a few years you want to see where
you've been at then you can actually go
ahead and private them or unlist them
that way only you will be able to see
them or anyone with the link and that
way they will never get deleted and
you'll always have them on your youtube
channel so that's my first tip clean up
your videos clean up your YouTube
channel make your channel look
professional

Tip 2 (good content, long watch time, get recommended by youtube)
---------
my second tip is to only create and post
highly watchable content so as you know
on YouTube views is actually less important than
watch duration or watch time  you want your video viewers 
to watch your entire video 

just as I said at the beginning of my
video not the entire video but a
large portion of it, so let's say 50 to
60 percent that's a good percentage of
the entire video that you want your
viewers to watch at least that 

but if you are below 50% then
you're actually less likely to get
suggested on YouTube.

It is important to be suggested, 
since that makes your video
show up on people's home page and that's
how they find your video 

so like there are two ways people can find your videos
either they search for them or they get
recommended 

if the videos get recommended to people then you'll
get a lot of views on those videos and 
when you go to analytics and check your
views for the last 60 minutes you will
see that if your views are very high
then you're likely recommended 

you can actually see where the traffic is coming
from and if you are recommended or
suggested 

well you want to encourage your viewer to watch a very
large portion of your videos so you want
to never lose the viewers attention so
you always have to do something don't
just be quiet for a whole minute since
that will always guarantee your viewer
to click away so always try to make them
stay on your video for as long as
possible since that will help your
ranking and your recommendation

Tip 3 (short videos, good watch time, recommended by youtube)
---------
my third tip is actually to make sure that your
videos are under 5 minutes and the
reason is that if your videos are long
than 55 minutes then your viewers aren't
likely to watch the entire video since
10 minutes is a long time and if your
content isn't that great
I mean if it's decent then it's a very
low possibility that your viewers or
most of your viewers will watch the
entire video 

so when you're a small
youtuber I always recommend people to
limit their videos to 5 minutes since
that way you're you're actually more
likely to get good watch time and as I
said before if you get good watch time
you're very likely you're a lot more
likely to grow that video and in turn
grow your channel so if you are new
youtuber go ahead and make your videos
below 5 minutes or if you actually have
really really good content then you can
make them longer but your watch duration
your average watch iteration may suffer

Tip 4 (put videos into play lists, autoplay, more views, suggested by youtube)
---------
another tip I have for you guys is to
put all of your videos or all of your
good videos into one playlist 

now having all your videos in one playlist will
cause viewers to not only watch one of
your videos but to watch them all or a
lot more than just one video since if
you have them in a playlist then
autoplay is automatically on which means
that when they watch one video the other
video will start playing almost right
away and if they don't click away and
they watch the entire playlist then
YouTube will know that viewers actually
like your content since they're watching
more of them 

so if you're getting like
the same amount of views of the same
viewers on every single video in that
playlist you're actually a lot more likely to get
prioritized by YouTube since they see
that viewers actually like your content

and if they do like your content if they
are engaging then you're actually more
likely to get suggested as I said before
and that will in turn help you gain
subscribers 

Tip 5 (customized  thumbnails)
---------

another tip is to create a custom human thumbnails 
now this is very important

some pretty flashy thumbnails
make people more likely to click on a
video and this will get you more views 
and more clicks and that's what it's all about 

it's about views and it's about watch time so
you need to create a human thumbnail and

it's actually better when you have a
custom thumbnail than just a random
image from the video since YouTube knows
that you actually put the time into the
video and when you put time into the
video YouTube rewards you 

so have a good
thumbnail that will cause more viewers
to click on your video to give you that
watch time since that will really really
help your video and your subscriber
amount to grow quickly


Tip 6 (consistent uploads, loyal audience)
----------

an hour tip is to
post awesome and consistently 

now if you
want loyal subscribers if you want
subscribers that will watch most of your
videos then you'll have to provide
content every now and then 

you can't
just provide one video a week or maybe
you can but not one video a month since
people will actually forget about your
channel and they might even unsubscribe
when they see that you upload a new
video since they don't even know who you
are or why the had subscribed to you 

so you should upload one every two or
three days to keep your viewers at your
page and keep them loyal so that they
don't unsubscribe and just keep
on watching your videos 

subscribers are actually the best people
to have to watch your videos since
subscribers sub for a reason 

they start because they want more content from you
and the subscribers are actually more
likely to watch a large portion of the
video than just random people that got
the video suggested or people that
search top your video so it's very
important to keep your subscribers
engaging so that they watch more of your
videos

Tip 7 (search optimization, good ranking, pop up on youtube search)
---------

another tip for you guys is to optimize
your YouTube channel for search 

so if you want to actually pop up on the
YouTube search you should go into your
advanced settings on YouTube

add a good description and title 
with custom keywords about your 
video content and your channel

 it's very important that
people can find your channel since
that's how they come back to your
channel after watching a few videos if
they didn't click Subscribe already so
definitely go ahead and add some
keywords that will help in your channels
ranking 

Tip 8 (ask viewers to subscribe)
-------

my absolute last tip is to ask
your viewers to subscribe now 

this is
very important because you have to
actively remind people or your viewers
to subscribe to you since they don't
always think about it

have you seen a
single YouTube video by a large youtuber
that don't ask you to subscribe at the
end of the video or the start?

Probably not, because it's
almost impossible to find such a video
and that's because it actually works
that's how they get more subs because
when you ask someone to subscribe to you
then they'll have to actively accept or
deny that request 

so if you don't ask
then they don't have to do anything and
then we'll just forget about subscribing
to a channel 

so definitely ask them
every time you render your video since
it will always or not always but most of
the time it will help you get your
viewers to actually subscribe to your
channel and watch more videos from you
in the future so that's my tips for you
guys if this video was helpful to you
please go ahead and leave a like and
subscribe to the channel and I'll see
you guys in the next video
