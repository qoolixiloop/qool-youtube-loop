gain views fast



00:00
hey guys my name is Tamara and welcome
00:01
back to a brand new video on the
00:03
channels in my last video I showed you
00:05
guys how to grow your YouTube channel by
00:07
getting more subs to YouTube channel and
00:09
in this video I'm actually gonna show
00:11
you guys how to get more views on the
00:13
videos you upload on your YouTube
00:15
channel so my last video did really good
00:17
and I hope this video does just as good
00:19
so I will have how to ask you guys to
00:21
please watch the entire video since
00:23
these tips will help you make your
00:26
videos get a lot of use just like my
00:27
last video so if you want a lot of use
00:31
in your videos then you should watch
00:32
this video and follow the points I'm
00:34
about to present to you
00:36
so with that out of the way let's get
00:38
started so my first tip is to have
00:41
longer videos on your channel and this
00:44
is because YouTube actually prioritizes
00:46
watch time and watch hours so if you
00:49
have a very long video let's say 10
00:51
minutes and people watch the entire
00:54
video which is hard by the way you have
00:55
to get them to watch the entire video
00:57
and if they do that then you will
00:59
actually get prioritized by YouTube Co
01:02
get 6 suggested recommend it to other
01:04
people and that will gain your views
01:06
since you'll end up on the home page of
01:08
people's YouTube and people are very
01:10
likely to click the video from there so
01:13
please just try to make people watch the
01:16
entire video just like I did in the
01:18
beginning if you watch the entire video
01:20
my entire video it will really help me
01:22
out just let someone helping you out
01:24
right now so try to get your viewers to
01:27
watch the entire video and you can't
01:29
just go ahead and ask like I did or if
01:31
you have other strategies to like keep
01:34
them engaged keep them you know come up
01:38
with surprises and and all that there is
01:40
a lot of strategies on how to do that my
01:44
second tip is to have better thumbnails
01:46
since you want people to actually be
01:49
clicking your videos if someone searches
01:51
up a video or a keyword and they find a
01:54
lot of different videos then they're
01:56
actually more likely to click on the
01:57
video that has a compelling thumbnail
01:59
say
02:00
they know that if the video has a good
02:03
thumbnail then the Creator actually
02:04
takes time into the video onto all
02:06
aspects of the video to even make the
02:09
thumbnail as good as possible and if the
02:11
tumbling is good then people think that
02:13
the content is good too so that's a very
02:15
very good tip that is she should be
02:17
using create compelling thumbnails that
02:20
really takes people's attention to your
02:24
video my third tip is to get at least
02:28
50% view duration on your videos so as I
02:30
said in our first tip it's very
02:32
important that you get your viewers to
02:34
watch a long part or a lot a large
02:37
portion of the video and if they watch
02:39
more than 50% then you have really good
02:42
duration and if you have good duration
02:44
you'll get prioritized by YouTube so it
02:47
kind of relates to my first tip to try
02:49
to make people watch at least 50% and a
02:53
way you can do that is to provide
02:55
content but it's not boring if content
02:57
is boring they're very likely to click
02:59
away from the video after the first 10
03:01
or 20 seconds so you'll try to make the
03:03
video very not boring and very exciting
03:08
to keep people just continuing watching
03:11
your video
03:13
another tip is to it actually doesn't
03:16
relate to the video it does relate to
03:18
the key or the keywords and the
03:20
description so descriptions are actually
03:22
very important in the algorithm of
03:24
YouTube so you want to have good
03:27
descriptions that people actually read
03:30
but they don't really have to read it
03:31
but if you have a good description that
03:33
YouTube will know that it is course it
03:34
is long it has keywords and you're more
03:37
likely to rank in the search results and
03:40
you're more likely to get suggested so
03:42
in your description you want to use the
03:44
right keywords to be found in search so
03:46
if people searches out let's say a
03:48
healthy video then you want to get into
03:51
the viewers mind and think about the
03:53
words that they would be searching for
03:55
and then you want to include those words
03:57
in your description and in your title
04:00
adults in your tags as well so you also
04:04
want to add a subscribe link since that
04:06
will help you get more subscribers that
04:08
will continue watching your videos so
04:10
you can actually your description below
04:12
you can copy the link that I have since
04:14
this link will actually drive people to
04:17
your page and then a pop-up will say
04:19
subscribe and it kind of makes them you
04:22
know either choose to subscribe or not
04:23
to subscribe and most people are very
04:25
likely to click Subscribe so copy that
04:27
link and don't forget to enter your own
04:30
channel URL into the link as well
04:31
otherwise still just be something to my
04:33
channel so go ahead and use that tip
04:36
it's very valuable
04:38
and in your description what should he
04:40
white well you should actually describe
04:43
your video as simple as it is so you
04:45
should say what you're about to or what
04:48
you are saying in the video and you
04:50
should also not really include any
04:52
Content that is not in the video since
04:54
you want to you know it's it's a brief
04:57
summary of your video that helps YouTube
05:00
and the viewers decide whether it's the
05:03
video for them or if they want to watch
05:04
it so make sure to go into detail about
05:07
your video in your descriptions and
05:11
already you could add in your
05:12
descriptions is to add timestamps these
05:15
will help people to navigate around your
05:17
video if it's quite long and people
05:19
actually truly appreciate timestamps if
05:21
they don't have a lot of time to watch
05:22
the video so if you have watch time or a
05:25
timestamp sorry then people instead of
05:28
clicking away from your video since they
05:30
can't find what you're looking for they
05:31
might find your timestamps in the
05:33
description and then they can click on
05:35
those timestamps which will still gain
05:37
you a lot of duration on your video so
05:40
that's a good tip that you should be
05:42
using another tip is to if it's boring
05:46
to write descriptions every time they
05:48
can actually go ahead and use default
05:49
uploads as you can see on the screen
05:51
here you can add default uploads that
05:53
will default every time you upload a
05:55
video that you can just edit the
05:56
description as you like but a large
05:59
portion is can still be there if you
06:01
don't want to type it out every time you
06:02
upload a video so it's very convenient I
06:05
use it for all my videos since I don't
06:07
have to write everything every time so
06:09
gonna use default uploads I really
06:12
really recommend it and my last tip on
06:15
the description is to use youtube
06:17
hashtags since hashtags actually help
06:19
you rank and if you rank as I said you
06:22
get views so try to write the hashtags
06:26
the hashtag should be same as attacks in
06:29
your video or kinda kind of the same
06:32
since that's what your video is about
06:34
and if you have let's say a tag called
06:37
how to in both your tags and the
06:39
description as a hash tag then you two
06:42
really knows that this is what your
06:43
video is about and you're more likely to
06:46
rank for that keyword so another tip
06:50
let's just leave the description behind
06:51
us another tip is to respond to every
06:54
comment you get on your videos so I
06:56
don't really do that right now since I
06:58
get a lot of comments but you're
06:59
probably a smaller youtuber that get
07:02
around like 10 to 20 comments a video
07:04
and if you respond to every comment not
07:06
only will you get more comments on your
07:08
videos but you will actually build a
07:10
community with your subscribers or
07:12
viewers and if you respond to your
07:14
comments they'll know that you actually
07:15
do care about them and they're more
07:17
likely to stick around to watch more of
07:19
your videos and probably even subscribe
07:21
so go ahead and just respond to every
07:24
single comment and if you didn't know
07:25
and a lot of people don't know this but
07:28
you can actually go into your creative
07:29
studio and go to the comments because
07:32
not only can you see all the comments
07:33
there but they're actually quick replies
07:35
which is AI generated that usually fits
07:39
the comments that you receives you can
07:41
just click on whatever response sounds
07:44
best and then you can just click on
07:46
reply that's a very fast way to do it I
07:48
don't really recommend it to do it all
07:50
time because it's kinda robotic and if
07:53
people found out and then they'll know
07:55
that you don't really care about them so
07:56
that's just a tip if you have a lot of
07:58
comments but if you don't then just go
08:01
ahead and type normal respond to every
08:04
comment another tip is to use the
08:07
community tab this tab allows you to
08:10
post messages to all of your subscribers
08:12
you can actually reach a lot of
08:15
subscribers if they have the
08:16
notifications put on and they'll see it
08:18
on their home page if they usually watch
08:21
your videos
08:22
so in the community tab you can type
08:24
whatever you want but you should use it
08:26
to promote your videos since not only
08:28
will they find it in their sub box but
08:30
they would also find it in their home
08:32
page in the form of a community tab so
08:35
you could ask your viewers to watch your
08:36
latest video you could click wait a bit
08:38
if you need and you should also respond
08:41
to the comments you get on the community
08:43
post so as you can see you can respond
08:46
to the community of community post
08:48
comments that we receive and that will
08:50
also increase the comments on the
08:52
community post which will put it higher
08:54
up on the homepage of your subscribers
08:56
so it's very important to use the
08:59
community tab you don't really have to
09:01
use it for your videos only you can do
09:03
it for whatever you want really but it's
09:05
very it's a very effective tip to drive
09:08
more views to your videos since your
09:10
subscribers are actually interesting
09:12
your content they just have to find it
09:14
so glad I use the community tab it's
09:17
very important that you do so and my
09:20
last tip is quite self-explanatory but
09:22
please use good content you want content
09:25
that is not boring you want content that
09:27
your viewers actually likes just don't
09:29
upload random test videos every upload
09:31
you upload to your channel should be of
09:33
high quality so givi your viewers and
09:36
subscribers don't bore out so that's
09:39
actually my last tip if you found this
09:41
video helpful then please leave a like

09:46

gain subs fast


00:00
yo what is the own guys my name is Tamar
00:01
and in this video I'm gonna be showing
00:03
you guys how to grow your YouTube
00:05
channel just like I did so as you can
00:07
see I have gained a lot of subs for the
00:09
past few days and past few weeks and in
00:13
this video I'm gonna show you every
00:15
single step that I use to grow my
00:17
YouTube channel but it's very important
00:20
that you watch the entire video since
00:22
you do not want to miss out on any of
00:23
the tips I'm about to show you since
00:25
every single tip will be very valuable
00:27
in growing your YouTube channels so
00:29
please go ahead and don't skip out on
00:31
any parts of the video just go ahead and
00:34
watch the entire video so that you learn
00:36
everything so that you have higher
00:38
chances of growing your own channel so
00:40
with that having said let's get into the
00:43
video my first tip is to actually clean
00:46
up your YouTube channel when I say clean
00:49
up I mean remove old videos that are no
00:52
longer relevant or have very bad quality
00:55
so let's say that your latest video is
00:58
really good quality and your viewers
01:00
actually think about subscribing after
01:03
seeing that video but once they go to
01:05
your channel and scroll down a bit they
01:07
see your old videos that are really bad
01:09
and that doesn't have any quality at all
01:12
and if they watched that video or those
01:15
videos then they're actually less likely
01:17
to hit subscribe and be a loyal follower
01:20
to your page so my tip is to actually
01:23
delete all the old videos or all videos
01:25
that don't that don't have good quality
01:28
and actually if you don't want to delete
01:30
them if you want them for like you know
01:33
in a few years you want to see where
01:34
you've been at then you can actually go
01:37
ahead and private them or unlist them
01:38
that way only you will be able to see
01:40
them or anyone with the link and that
01:43
way they will never get deleted and
01:45
you'll always have them on your youtube
01:47
channel so that's my first tip clean up
01:49
your videos clean up your YouTube
01:51
channel make your channel look
01:53
professional
01:54
my second tip is to only create a post
01:57
highly watchable content so as you know
02:00
on YouTube
02:00
Buse is actually less important than
02:03
watch duration or watch time you want
02:06
your video viewers to watch your entire
02:08
video just as I said in beginning of my
02:10
video you are not the entire video but a
02:13
large portion of it so let's say 50 to
02:16
60 percent that's a good percentage of
02:18
the entire video that you want your
02:20
viewers to watch at least that but if
02:23
you like if you are below 50% then
02:26
you're actually less likely to get
02:27
suggested on YouTube and suggestions
02:30
will actually bring you since that's
02:32
what shows up like it makes your video
02:35
show up on people's home page and that's
02:38
how they find your video so like there
02:40
are two ways people can find your videos
02:42
either they search for them or they get
02:44
recommended if the videos get
02:46
recommended to them and if your videos
02:50
get recommended to people then you'll
02:52
get a lot of views on those videos and I
02:54
actually speak from experience since I
02:56
had a few videos get recommended and
02:59
when you go to analytics and check your
03:01
views for the last 60 minutes they will
03:04
see that if your views are very high
03:06
then you're likely recommended you can
03:08
actually see where the traffic is coming
03:10
from and if your recommended or
03:12
suggested it's the same thing then it
03:14
will say suggested videos and that's how
03:17
you know that you got recommended or
03:19
suggested by YouTube how the post highly
03:24
watchable content well you want to
03:26
encourage your viewer to watch a very
03:29
large portion of your videos so you want
03:31
to never lose the viewers attention so
03:35
you always have to do something don't
03:36
just be quiet for a whole minute since
03:38
that will always guarantee your viewer
03:40
to click away so always try to make them
03:43
stay on your video for as long as
03:46
possible since that will help your
03:47
ranking and your recommendation my third
03:51
tip is actually to make sure that your
03:53
videos are under 5 minutes and the
03:55
reason is that if your videos are long
03:59
than 55 minutes then your viewers aren't
04:02
likely to watch the entire video since
04:04
10 minutes is a long time and if your
04:06
content isn't that great
04:08
I mean if it's decent then it's a very
04:11
low possibility that your viewers or
04:14
most of your viewers will watch the
04:15
entire video so when you're a small
04:18
youtuber I always recommend people to
04:22
limit their videos to 5 minutes since
04:24
that way you're you're actually more
04:27
likely to get good watch time and as I
04:29
said before if you get good watch time
04:32
you're very likely you're a lot more
04:34
likely to grow that video and in turn
04:38
grow your channel so if you are new
04:41
youtuber go ahead and make your videos
04:43
below 5 minutes or if you actually have
04:46
really really good content then you can
04:47
make them longer but your watch duration
04:50
your average watch iteration may suffer
04:53
another tip I have for you guys is to
04:55
put all of your videos or all of your
04:57
good videos into one playlist now having
05:01
all your videos in one playlist will
05:03
cause viewers to not only watch one of
05:05
your videos but to watch them all or a
05:07
lot more than just one video since if
05:10
you have them in a playlist then
05:12
autoplay is automatically on which means
05:15
that when they watch one video the other
05:17
video will start playing almost right
05:18
away and if they don't click away and
05:21
they watch the entire playlist then
05:23
YouTube will know that viewers actually
05:24
like your content since they're watching
05:26
more of them so if you're getting like
05:29
the same amount of views the same
05:31
viewers on every single video in that
05:33
playlist
05:33
you're actually a lot more likely to get
05:37
prioritized by YouTube since they see
05:40
that viewers actually like your content
05:42
and if they do like your content if they
05:45
are engaging then you're actually more
05:47
likely to get suggested as I said before
05:49
and that will in turn help you gain
05:52
subscribers and another tip is to create
05:55
custom human thumbnails now this is very
05:58
important as you can see by this video
05:59
it has a pretty flashy thumbnail that
06:02
made you more likely to click on this
06:03
video and the reason I made that is
06:05
because
06:06
you get more views you get more clicks
06:08
and that's what it's all about it's
06:09
about views and it's about watch time so
06:12
you need to create a human thumbnail and
06:14
it's actually better when you have a
06:16
custom thumbnail than just a random
06:18
image from the video since YouTube knows
06:21
that you actually put the time into the
06:23
video and when you put time into the
06:25
video YouTube rewards you so have a good
06:28
thumbnail that will cause more viewers
06:30
to click on your video to give you that
06:32
watch time since that will really really
06:35
help your video and your subscriber
06:37
amount to grow quickly an hour tip is to
06:43
post awesome and consistently now if you
06:47
want loyal subscribers if you want
06:48
subscribers that will watch most of your
06:50
videos then it'll have to provide
06:52
content every now and then you can't
06:54
just provide one video a week or maybe
06:56
you can but not one video a month since
06:59
people will actually forget about your
07:01
channel and they might even unsubscribe
07:03
when they see that you upload a new
07:05
video since they don't even know who you
07:06
are or why'd your sub to you so you
07:09
should upload maybe one or every two or
07:12
three days to keep your viewers at your
07:15
page and keep them loyal so that they
07:18
don't unsubscribe and so they just keep
07:20
on watching your view or a video since
07:23
subscribers are actually the best people
07:25
to have to watch your videos since
07:27
subscribers sub for a reason they start
07:30
because they want more content from you
07:32
and the subscribers are actually more
07:34
likely to watch a large portion of the
07:36
video than just random people that got
07:39
the video suggested or people that
07:41
search top your video so it's very
07:43
important to keep your subscribers
07:46
engaging so that they watch more of your
07:48
videos
07:49
[Music]
07:56
another tip for you guys is to optimize
07:58
your YouTube channel for search so if
08:01
you want to actually pop up on the
08:03
YouTube search you should go into your
08:04
advanced settings on YouTube and go
08:07
ahead and add custom keywords preferably
08:11
your channel name because that will
08:13
almost guarantee that your channel will
08:15
pop up when people search for your
08:17
channel since if you don't do that then
08:20
maybe random videos will pop up and
08:21
people won't be able to find your
08:23
channel and it's very important that
08:24
people can find your channel since
08:26
that's how they come back to your
08:28
channel after watching a few videos if
08:30
they didn't click Subscribe already so
08:32
definitely go ahead and add some
08:33
keywords that will help in your channels
08:35
ranking my absolute last tip is to ask
08:38
your viewers to subscribe now this is
08:41
very important because you have to
08:42
actively remind people or your viewers
08:45
to subscribe to you since they don't
08:46
always think about it have you seen a
08:48
single YouTube video by a large youtuber
08:51
that don't ask you to subscribe at the
08:53
end of the video or the start it's
08:55
almost impossible to find such a video
08:57
and that's because it actually works
08:59
that's how they get more subs because
09:00
when you ask someone to subscribe to you
09:02
then they'll have to actively accept or
09:06
deny that request so if you don't ask
09:09
then they don't have to do anything and
09:11
then we'll just forget about subscribing
09:12
to a channel so definitely ask them
09:16
every time you render your video since
09:18
it will always or not always but most of
09:21
the time it will help you get your
09:23
viewers to actually subscribe to your
09:25
channel and watch more videos from you
09:28
in the future so that's my tips for you
09:30
guys if this video was helpful to you
09:32
please go ahead and leave a like and
09:34

00:12

should get away since you actually have
00:15
to do a few things and it's easier for
00:17
you to win if you actually want to win
00:19
so the way you win is that you have to
00:22

00:27
of time so let's say someone gets their
00:29
name commented 10 times and another guy
00:32

00:34
obviously they get with 20 comments will
00:36
receive the giveaway so if you want to
00:39

00:40
friends to comment your channel name on

00:54

00:57
most comments mentioned their name on
00:59

01:01
shout-out then go ahead and enter it
01:03

01:05

01:08
to give you the shoutout on my community
01:09
page or community tab so a lot of people
01:12
will be able to see it and as I said I'm
01:14
gonna do 5 giveaways and I'm gonna space
01:16
them out a bit so that's every single
01:18
giveaway it gets the the amount of
01:20
attention it deserves
01:22
so without out of the way let's get into
01:24
what this video is actually about so my
01:26
first tip is to make videos that are
01:29
like worthy so if your video has high
01:31
quality then of course people are a lot
01:34
more likely to like your video just
01:37
naturally so try to make quality videos
01:40
and it should educate the viewer and
01:43
answer the viewers question if it's an
01:45
educational video or entertain the
01:47
viewer or just you know cover subject
01:50
well so if you make naturally good
01:53
content then the likes are actually more
01:55
likely to roll in but my second tip will
01:58
actually help you a lot more if the
02:00
content isn't that good
02:01
since this tip is to tell your viewers
02:04
to like your video so as I'm sending my
02:06
previous videos telling your subscribers
02:08
or telling your viewers to subscribe to
02:10
you increases the chances of them
02:13
actually subbing to you after watching
02:14
the video and the same goes with likes
02:16
so you can tell your viewers to like
02:19
your video when you should tell them why
02:20
they should do that maybe if they like
02:22
the video or if they found it helpful
02:24
then they should like so go ahead and
02:26
ask them that you should like say liking
02:29
this video helps me to create more
02:30
videos just like this one and that might
02:32
make them more you know kind to leave a
02:34
like on your video and my third tip is
02:38
to gain lots of subscribers so we all
02:42
know that subscribers are a lot more
02:44
likely to like your videos to watch your
02:46
videos to watch large portions of your
02:49
videos since they are therefore our
02:51
reason and a random viewers that just
02:53
found finds your video on the homepage
02:55
or on your you turn on their youtube
02:58
search they're not really likely to
03:00
subscribe or like your video since they
03:02
are actually looking for something
03:04
they're not there to support you as a
03:05
creator so if you can get people to
03:08
subscribe to you and stay loyal to your
03:10
channel then these people or those
03:12
people are a lot more likely to both
03:15
like and subscribe and or not subscribe
03:18
have both like and comment on your
03:19
videos another tip is to promote your
03:22
videos everywhere so you can grab your
03:25
video link and this link can be used to
03:28
share it everywhere on every social
03:30
media page that you have so let's say
03:32
you have a lot of subscribe a lot of
03:33
followers on Instagram then you could
03:36
share it share the video link on
03:37
Instagram or in your bio or in a new
03:40
post and all of your followers on
03:42
Instagram will be able to see that link
03:44
and that's how you can get a lot more
03:46
traffic from different places other than
03:48
YouTube you can also use Twitter is have
03:51
a Twitter page with a lot of followers
03:52
you can use Facebook there's a lot of
03:55
different social media platforms that
03:56
you can use to drive traffic to your
03:58
YouTube channel
04:00
so glad I use that tip if you have a lot
04:02
of followers outside YouTube another tip
04:05
is the post videos consistently so as
04:07
I've said in my previous videos if you
04:09
post videos consistently then your
04:11
viewers or subscribers are more likely
04:13
to stick around since they know that
04:15
more content is coming and they want to
04:17
support you as a creator so if you
04:19
upload me once or twice a week that's
04:22
not enough since people will forget
04:24
about you you should upload maybe every
04:26
other day or every day if you want to
04:28
since then people won't forget about you
04:30
they'll get a notification every time
04:31
you upload a video and then they're more
04:33
likely to click on the notification go
04:35
into your video watch the entire video
04:37
like and comment which will give you
04:40
more engagement and more likes which is
04:42
what you want so go ahead and upload
04:44
consistently it will really help you in
04:47
the long run another tip is to watch my
04:50
other video where I show you how to get
04:52
more subs on YouTube since having more
04:54
subscribers will actually increase your
04:56
chances of your viewers like in your
04:58
video since having a lot of subscribers
05:00
looks a lot better than just having like
05:02
10 or 100 subs so maybe you should focus
05:05
on increasing your subscriber amounts
05:07
before trying to increase your likes on
05:09
your videos but you can actually do this
05:11
at the same time you just have to watch
05:13
all my three different videos I actually
05:15
have one about how to gain more views
05:17
which will help you gain more
05:18
subscribers which will help you gain
05:21
more likes I have 3 videos on my channel
05:22
right now and you should watch every
05:25
single one since it will truly help you
05:27
build your YouTube channel and get
05:29
monetized in the future another tip is
05:32
to maximize your search engine
05:34
optimization so what SEO is it's quite
05:38
the it's a practice of ranking high on
05:42
YouTube or on any search engine and
05:44
YouTube is actually a search engine for
05:46
videos on their website so there is a
05:48
few tips that you can use to rank higher
05:51
than everyone else for a specific
05:53
keyword or specific keywords and I'm
05:56
actually gonna show you guys a few
05:57
strategies in this video too
05:59
so the title has to be good to rank high
06:02
- you have to include the keywords that
06:05
you think that the viewers are gonna
06:06
search for since those are the keywords
06:08
that you are gonna have to rank on so
06:11
you don't just have to use one keyword
06:13
you have to use a few different keywords
06:15
that will that viewers will include in
06:18
their search on YouTube so what I don't
06:20
do that but also you should use the same
06:23
keywords in your description but in a
06:26
sentence or a few sentences since this
06:28
will let YouTube know that the video is
06:30
actually about what the title is about
06:32
and you know YouTube is all about giving
06:35
the viewers the right experience the
06:37
best experience and if you to be certain
06:39
that your video is related to their
06:42
keyword search then you're more likely
06:44
to rank higher up and get the clicks on
06:46
your videos and another way that could
06:48
help you get the actual click is to use
06:50
good thumbnails as I have said in my
06:52
previous videos so you should have a
06:53
thumb nail that sticks out that sticks
06:56
out from the crowd and that looks
06:59
compelling and you know it shows that
07:03
your content is good and it's worth
07:04
watching so don't forget to have a
07:06
custom thumbnail and if you don't know
07:08
how to do that then just tell me in the
07:10
display in the comment section below
07:11
and I might actually make a video in the
07:14
future showing how you can do that
07:15
reckon also just say in this video that
07:18
you have to verify your YouTube channel
07:20
with your phone number and if you don't
07:22
have on a phone then you can add a
07:25
custom thumbnail in your YouTube studio
07:27
app but on a on a PC then it's just in
07:30
the regular uploader now another tip is
07:32
to use end screens at the end of your
07:34
videos so what are entries well it's
07:36
basically your channel or you can
07:38
actually customize whatever you wanted
07:40
to say but usually it's your channel and
07:42
a video that you want your viewer to
07:44
watch so if you if you scroll all the
07:46
way to the end of you watch this entire
07:48
video then you'll see that there are a
07:50
few accord on the screen and my channel
07:53
and you can also use this on your video
07:55
since it will help bring the traffic to
07:58
not only the video they're watching
07:59
right now
08:00
like you're watching this one but you
08:01
can also bring the traffic to other
08:03
videos and that can help them like those
08:06
readers too so that your overall channel
08:08
like likes will go up so go ahead and
08:12
use end screens it will truly help you
08:14
just you know throw around the viewers -
08:17
all of your videos which will help you
08:20
get more views likes and subscribers
08:23

08:25
actually using right now if i'm using it

08:29

since that will get you traffic
08:55
