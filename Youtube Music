Free music attribution & monetization

    Attributing your video: If you see an attribution-required icon next to a track, make sure to credit the original artist in your video description. Learn more about attribution on the Creative Commons website.
    Monetizing your video: You can monetize your video since free music isn't claimed through Content ID. If you're asked to show that you have commercial use rights to the music, include the music's exact title. Additionally, state that you downloaded the music from the YouTube Audio Library. Learn more about supplying documentation to claim rights.
